# Product Overview

## Context

Emma Demo is a cryptocurrency chatbot application designed to showcase advanced tool selection capabilities. The core demonstration focuses on intelligent tool filtering: reducing a large pool of 100-200 available tools down to 1-10 relevant tools based on user queries.

## Purpose

- **Primary Goal**: Demonstrate sophisticated tool selection logic that intelligently filters crypto-related API tools
- **Use Case**: Analyze crypto-related data from various applications through natural language chat interface
- **Demo Focus**: Tool selection algorithm that efficiently narrows down tool candidates

## Key Features

### Chat Interface
- Single chat page with persistent chat history
- Device-based user identification (no authentication required)
- Real-time message exchange with AI assistant
- Chat list sidebar for managing multiple conversations

### Tool Management
- Tools stored in database with hierarchical structure: App → Class → Method
- Each method represents an API endpoint with:
  - HTTP verb (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.)
  - Path and description
  - Typed arguments with descriptions
  - Return type information
- Support for 100-200 tools across multiple crypto applications

### Architecture Highlights
- Server Actions for all data operations
- Type-safe implementation with TypeScript
- OpenAI SDK integration (currently spoofed, to be implemented)
- PostgreSQL database with Prisma ORM

## Current State

- **MVP Phase**: Basic chat interface and database schema complete
- **Pending**: Tool selection logic implementation
- **Pending**: OpenAI integration (currently returns placeholder responses)
- **Pending**: Tool population (database ready, awaiting data)

## User Flow

1. User visits app → Device key generated/stored in localStorage
2. User automatically gets new chat or selects existing chat
3. User sends message about crypto data analysis
4. System filters 100-200 tools down to 1-10 relevant tools (to be implemented)
5. AI assistant responds using selected tools
6. Conversation history persists across sessions
